# Chip8Emu
Chip8 Emulator written with the help of libGDX in Java. Really fun project that helped me understand concepts of emulation(I hope that in the near future I will end up contributing something useful to much bigger emulators).

At start it scans assets/roms directory and prints the result in console. To begin you have to select the game by pressing 0-9. If you want to reset and choose another game, press space key any time.
